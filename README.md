# scrapyard
The results of messing around with Python. Tests, smaller projects, silly ideas.
(small note: In case you would like to *for some reason*  use my crappy code, feel free to do it. Just don't do it commercially and include my nick and repo link in the credits.)
#### Featured Scripts:
utils/caesar.py\
math/super30.py

-----
## [consoleGames](consoleGames)
### BATTLE.CO_infinite
unfinished text-based rpg game project. 3 heroes facing randomly-generated monsters every day. Old script, repeatable copy-pasted lines... not worth checking out

-----
## [fileOperations](fileOperations)
### DataManagingScript
"Database" tests from times before I heard about JSON or SQL or others. Write prompts to console to modify data.py. Also, a test for importing other python files

-----
## [math](math)
### DividingDividers
Lists all dividers of a number. Highly uneffective, has problems with any number that is longer than 7 digits. But it works.
### NumberGrater
Search for prime dividers. Just like in elementary school.
### PascalResearcher
Basically searches for next rows of the Pascal pyramid endlessly.
### SanicPrimes
Third version of my primes searching script, could be better though.
### super30
Simple script I wrote for my brother learning basic math. Shows you a bunch of numbers to add together. You can change variables at the beginning of the code to make the task more difficult.

-----
## [sillyStuff](sillyStuff)
### FizzBuzz
Nothing special. My take on a simple script that apparently is a part of recruitment process for some companies.
### OKinator
basically replaces all letters in the input with respective amount of "ok" for the position in the alphabet of said key. Example of use is in the out.txt file. Try to guess what was this file previously!
### SimpleBotMacro
Macro that switches between two accounts on Discord and constantly runs Pokecord duel commands to gain XP. In order to make it work, immediately after starting script press the text box in first window, then press the second textbox in the second window. I recommend having all three windows: browser, console and discord app next to each other. Stop the script by holding (CTRL). also close all windows besides those required just in case something goes wrong
### SuperPowerRandomiser
Ever wanted to become a superhero? Now it's a dream come true with paranormal abilities, pasionately designed by Redditors! Get random powers from subreddits of your choice, by utilising PRAW library. Remember to create an app on webside to which link is provided in the code, and fill out the detais in the 9th line!

-----
## [utils](utils)
### Alarm
Simple alarm with TTS message activacting on specified time. works on macOS
### BinaryClock
Simple raspberry pi clock displaying time in binary on LED's connected together with cables and resistors.
### Brute1V4N
More of a silly idea executed in a weird way, it's supposed to generate all possible combinations with letters up to 20 character string. who knew that 20 nested loops is the maximum...
### caesar
The most basic cipher there is. The script decodes and encodes text using Caesar cipher. If you don't know the "key", just use the bruteforcing function!
### Timer
Alarm, but activates after specified amount of seconds.
